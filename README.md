# Rules of the game

Design a program that displays a couplet of the user's favorite music: "99 shooters sans alcool", based on what the user has entered. This number must be between 0 and 99.

___
## How the program works

You have to type in a integer from 0 to 99 then hit the button to get the appropriate couplet displayed.

If you type anything other than integers between 0 and 99, an error message will appear with your entry in red, prompting you to start over.
